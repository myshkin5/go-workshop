# What is Go

- Created by Google in 2007
- Roots in Algol and C
- Strong concurrency and network constructs
- Minimalist's language
    - Just 25 keywords (50 for Java, 39 for Scala)
    - Just 47 operators (28 to 42 for Java, Scala -- too hard to count! At least 56)
    - 51 page language spec (780 for Java, 191 for Scala)
- Compiles to machine code
    - Very fast compiler
- Static type system
    - Most type decisions made at compile time
- Opinionated
    - Typically just one way to do things
- Garbage collection
- Only one style (`go fmt`)

Developers spend the first week or so very interested in the language, then the next six months hating it. If they stick with it that long, they learn to love the language again.
